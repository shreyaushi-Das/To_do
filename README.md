## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Add Tasks**  
  Input your task and click "Add" to see it appear in the list instantly.

- 🗑️ **Delete Tasks**  
  Delete a task by entering its **index number**—not the task text—making it efficient and typo-proof.

- ✏️ **Update Tasks**  
  Update existing tasks using their index numbers to quickly overwrite with new content.

- 📋 **Task Table Layout**  
  Your tasks are displayed in a neatly structured table with the following columns:
  - `#` – Serial number
  - `Task` – Task description
  - `Done?` – Checkbox to mark task as completed

- 🎯 **Mark as Done**  
  Once a task is marked as done via the checkbox:
  - The task text gets **line-through styling**
  - The task color turns **gray**, visually indicating its completion
